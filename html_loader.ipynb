      "In April 2025, Cisco Talos identified a Chinese-speaking cybercrime group, tracked as UAT-8099, which targets a broad range of vulnerable IIS servers across specific regions. This group focuses on high-value IIS servers that have a good reputation within these areas to manipulate search engine results for financial gain.\n",
      "UAT-8099 operates as a cybercrime group conducting SEO fraud. Additionally, UAT-8099 uses Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to access IIS servers and search for valuable data such as logs, credentials, configuration files and sensitive certificates, which they package for possible resale or further exploitation.\n",
      "Upon discovering a vulnerability in a target server, the group uploads a web shell to collect system information and conduct reconnaissance on the host network. They then enable the guest account, escalate its privileges to administrator level, and use this account to enable RDP. For persistence, they combine RDP access withSoftEther VPN,EasyTier(a decentralized virtual private network tool) andFRPreverse proxy tool. Subsequently, the group performs further privilege escalation using shared tools to gain system-level permissions and install BadIIS malware. To secure their foothold, they deploy defense mechanisms to prevent other threat actors from compromising the same server or disrupting their setup.\n",
      "This blog post provides a comprehensive overview of the campaign’s victimology, including the regions affected and the potential consequences of BadIIS infections. It also details the attack chain, automation scripts employed, and the malware and shared hacking tools UAT-8099 commonly uses.\n",
      "Based on Cisco's file census and DNS traffic analysis, the affected IIS server regions include India, Thailand, Vietnam, Canada and Brazil. The targeted IIS servers are owned by organizations such as universities, technology companies and telecommunications providers. The compromised IIS servers redirect users to unauthorized advertisements or illegal gambling websites. The languages used on these websites assists with identifying the targeted regions or countries. While Talos observed that most victims were located within the same region as the compromised servers, some victims were affected when accessing compromised servers in different regions.\n",
      "The majority of their targets are mobile users, encompassing not only Android devices but also Apple iPhone devices.\n",
      "In this campaign, the UAT-8099 group took advantage of weak settings in the web server’s file upload feature.\n",
      "The target web server allowed users to upload files to the server, but did not restrict the file type, which allowed UAT-8099 to upload the web shell. This established initial access and gave them control over the compromised server. The following is the detected location of the web shell used in this campaign, which is identified as the open-source “ASP.NET Web BackDoor” web shell:\n",
      "After dropping the web shell, Talos observed the actor utilizing it to execute commands such as ipconfig, whoami, arp and tasklist to collect system information and discover the host network information. Once the collection of information is complete, UAT-8099 enables the guest account, setss a password, and elevate the guest user privileges to administrator level, including the ability to access the system using RDP. Then, the actor uses another command to identify the network ports on which the TermService (Remote Desktop Services) process is actively listening. After completing creating a guest account and enabling the RDP on that target IIS server, the actor created ahidden account “admin$”and added it to Administrator permission privilege for long-term persistence.\n",

      "Talos also observed UAT-8099 dropping and executing three batch script files in some attacks to automate their tasks or to set up the compromised server for persistence and SEO fraud. The first script is for IIS module installation, as documented in TalosDragonRankandTrend Microblog posts.\n",
      "The second script is for configuring RDP settings and related network activity on a Windows system, including past RDP usage, the RDP listening port, the status of the RDP service, associated network activity, and to configure the Windows firewall to allow RDP.\n",
      "The third set of scripts is designed to establish and immediately trigger a persistent, high privilege scheduled task using “inetinfo.exe”, and then list all system scheduled tasks. The inetinfo.exe is a legitimate file “WMI V2 provider code generation tool” that is used by the actor to do DLL sideloading and run the Cobalt Strike in memory. The detailed Cobalt Strike analysis will be described in the next section.\n",
      "Talos observed UAT-8099 utilized Cobalt Strike as their backdoor in this campaign. They employed DLL sideloading as a method to execute the backdoor and also established a scheduled task to maintain persistence on the compromised systems.\n",
      "The encrypted first-stage payload is embedded within the wmicodegen.dll file. When this DLL is loaded by the legitimate WMI V2 provider code generation tool, it uses the VirtualQuery API to allocate a block of memory specifically for this first-stage payload.\n",
      "After decrypting the first stage payload, we can see both the second stage payload combined with a small piece of shellcode, and the third stage payload, which is encrypted and encoded with Base64.\n",
      "When jumping into the third stage payload, we observed it is a DLL file but without the original PE header. We also identify this third stage payload as the User-Defined Reflective Loader for the Cobalt Strike beacon. The erased original PE header and heavy obfuscation in each stage are consistent with theblog description. In addition, the machine information collection structure is also the same as the beacon structure such as listener name, computer name, username and process name. The listener name in this campaign is PUBG.\n",
      "Most importantly, the DLL file contains the “udrl.x64.dll” and “customLoader” inside that also match with the User-Defined Reflective Loader blog description. Using a URL that mimics a legitimate content delivery network (CDN), along with ports andpaths typical of Exchange servers, enables the attacker to blend in with normal network traffic and avoid detection by security analysts.\n",
      "Talos' analysis of the BadIIS variants used in this campaign revealed functional and URL pattern similarities to a variant previously documented in the Black Hat USA 2021white paperand aTrend Micro blog. However, this new BadIIS malware has altered its code structure and functional workflow to evade detection by antivirus products. Additionally, we identified several instances of the BadIIS malware on VirusTotal this year. One cluster exhibited very low detection rates and the other showed simplified Chinese debug strings inside the malware.\n",
      "The first cluster of new BadIIS malware implements handlers named “CHttpModule::OnBeginRequest” and “CHttpModule::OnSendResponse”. Both handlers use the \"User-Agent\" and \"Referer\" fields from the incoming HTTP headers to determine which malicious function to execute. Specifically, this malware targets requests where the \"User-Agent\" is Googlebot and the \"Referer\" is google.com, confirming that the user and crawler accessed the compromised website via the Google search engine only. Below, we describe how the malicious functions, including proxy, injector and SEO fraud, trigger.\n",
      "The OnBeginRequest handler processes incoming requests by examining the \"User-Agent\" and \"Referer\" HTTP headers to proxy or Injector responses. When the request is detected as originating from Googlebot and meets a specific URL path condition, the request is forwarded through a Proxy function. The targeted URL path pattern is as follows:\n",
      "Alternatively, if the request is not from Googlebot, the system then checks if it was referred by a Google search and if the same URL path condition is satisfied, in which case it proceeds to inject JavaScript. The injected JavaScript embeds a C2 URL such as “http://[C2]/jump.html” or “http://[C2]/pg888.js”. This injection enables the actor to compromise users’ browsers by downloading malicious scripts from the C2 server.\n",
      "The OnSendResponse handler first performs SEO fraud by delivering specific content from C2 server to requests where the \"User-Agent\" is Googlebot, manipulating search rankings to increase the visibility of the malicious content. This C2 content typically appears as a URL like “http://[C2]/u.php”. Subsequently, the function targets human users by conditionally injecting JavaScript when a request comes from a Google search and results in a 404 or 500 error page.\n",
      "Proxy mode\n",
      "When operating in proxy mode, BadIIS first verifies the URL path to ensure the process is running in the correct mode. It then extracts the embedded C2 server address, which is encoded in hexadecimal bytes, and uses this C2 as a proxy to retrieve content from a secondary C2 server, subsequently responding to the IIS server.\n",
      "Before responding to the Google crawler, it modifies the response data to resemble a valid HTTP response and uses the native HTTP module API \"WriteEntityChunks\" to insert data into the body of the HTTP response.\n",
      "SEO fraud mode\n",
      "Talos identified that the actor employs a conventional SEO technique known as backlinking to boost website visibility. Google's search engine uses backlinks to discover additional sites and assess keyword relevance. A higher number of backlinks increases the likelihood of Google crawlers visiting a site, which can accelerate ranking improvements and enhance exposure for the webpages. However, simply accumulating backlinks without regard to quality can lead to penalties from Google. Algorithms likePenguin, introduced in 2012, andSpamBrain, launched in 2022, rigorously evaluate backlink quality. To exploit this, the actor compromises multiple IIS servers across the internet to conduct SEO fraud. In this SEO fraud mode, BadIIS serves numerous backlinks with HTML content to Google crawlers to improve search engine rankings.\n",
      "One example of a backlink from the C2 server is shown in Figure 25, with additional compromised IIS servers performing similar backlink SEO fraud.\n",
      "Injector mode\n",
      "In injector mode, BadIIS intercepts browser requests originating from Google search results. It connects to the C2 server to retrieve JavaScript code, then uses the “WriteEntityChunks” API to embed the downloaded JavaScript into the HTML content of the response. It then returns the altered response to redirect the user to the destination intended by the actor.\n",
      "BadIIS retrieves malicious JavaScript code from a C2 server and redirects users to malicious websites instead of legitimate ones. By not embedding the JavaScript code directly in the binary, it allows easier modification of the redirect targets and helps evade detection by antivirus security products. The script is programmed to show a brief loading message before automatically redirecting the user to a malicious site. The redirect function and alert message vary across different C2 servers; some scripts reference two C2 servers and randomly select one with a 50% probability. Additionally, the alert message language is tailored to match the target region of the user.\n",
      "The second cluster of the new BadIIS malware also includes handlers named “CHttpModule::OnBeginRequest” and “CHttpModule::OnSendResponse”. In this cluster, OnBeginRequest is used as a decision point to execute before any intensive processing occurs, while OnSendResponse handles output modification to ensure that no other module can override the redirect. This cluster also features three modes: SEO fraud mode, injector mode and proxy mode. Notably, the injector and proxy modes operate under the SEO fraud mode umbrella, which itself has four variants tailored to different scenarios:\n",
      "The URL path pattern referred to as “Tezhengma” in the debug strings by the actor includes multiple versions. Some of these versions partially match the patterns found in the first cluster of BadIIS malware.\n",
      "The injector mode injects JavaScript in each SEO fraud type when the user-agent and referer do not match its criteria. The algorithm is same as the first cluster BadIIS; it verifies the user-agent to identify search engine crawlers and checks the referer to determine if the user is browsing from an expected source.\n",
